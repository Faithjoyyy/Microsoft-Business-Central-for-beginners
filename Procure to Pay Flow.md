## Creating and Posting Purchase Orders

In Business Central, transactional records like purchase orders are referred to as documents. These documents open in layered windows, allowing users to navigate between the Role Center, vendor cards, and purchase orders without leaving the current session.

When creating a purchase order, users select items from the catalog (e.g., Paris Chair, Rome Guest Chair). Business Central automatically pulls item details from master records and populates the order lines. Quantities and pricing are entered line by line, and totals (including tax) are calculated instantly.

The Fact Box on the right continues to show vendor-related information while working on the document.

Once the order is complete, users can post the document. Business Central prompts the user to choose the next step:
- Receive: Confirm that items have been received.
- Invoice: Record that payment is due.
- Receive and Invoice: Complete both steps at once.

Posting the document updates its status from Open to Released, locking it into the system. This process follows the Procure-to-Pay flow:
1. Purchase Order
2. Item Receipt
3. Invoice
4. Payment

Business Central handles these steps efficiently, allowing users to manage procurement with speed and accuracy.
