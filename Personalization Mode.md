## Personalization and Settings

Under the Settings tab in Business Central, users can access the Personalize option. This feature allows you to customize the layout and content of any page, including the Role Center. When activated, the system enters personalization mode, indicated by a light gray bar and red dots.

Users can rearrange tiles, hide or show fields, and add new elements using drag-and-drop. For example, you can move the "Purchasing" tab next to "Shopify" or remove "Sales Quotes" from view. This flexibility makes it easy to tailor the interface to your workflow.

If needed, you can reset changes using the Clear Personalization option or exit personalization mode by clicking Done.

Additionally, the Account Manager button shows which Microsoft account you're logged in with. From here, you can switch accounts or log out.

These features make Business Central highly adaptable to individual roles and preferences, offering a more efficient and personalized user experience.
