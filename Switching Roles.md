## Role Switching in Business Central

In this part of the video, the presenter explains that we are currently using the Business Manager role. This role provides broad access to many features and capabilities within Business Central. If a user has multiple roles assigned, they can switch between them easily.

Since this is a trial account, the presenter demonstrates how to switch roles. He scrolls down and selects the Sales and Relationship Manager role. Before switching, he points out the features visible in the Business Manager role, such as dashboards and access to various modules.

After switching to the Sales and Relationship Manager role, the interface updates to show features tailored to sales activities. These include sections like Sales Analysis, Administration, Contacts, and Open Opportunities.

To switch back, the presenter goes to the settings and selects the Business Manager role again. He also highlights that users can set preferences such as the date, company name, and timezone, although these settings usually donâ€™t need to be changed.

The system reloads the Business Manager role, restoring the original interface and access level.
