## Navigation and Reporting Tools

To return to the Role Center (home base), users can close layered windows by clicking the gray tabs on the left. This collapses open pages and brings the user back to the main dashboard.

Business Central offers several built-in reporting tools:
- Role Center Tiles: Display real-time statistics and KPIs.
- List Views: Act as dynamic reports with filtering and analysis options.
- Financial Reports: Accessible via the Finance tab, including balance sheets, income statements, and more.

Reports can be customized using filters (e.g., date ranges, display formats) and exported to Excel for further analysis or printing. Users can also integrate Power BI for advanced analytics and visualizations.

These tools make Business Central a powerful platform for both operational and financial reporting, supporting informed decision-making across departments.
