## Cards and Documents in Business Central

In Business Central, individual records are referred to as cards. These include vendors, customers, employees, items, fixed assets, and other master data. Each card has a consistent layout with editable fields and a fact box on the right showing related information.

For example, opening the vendor card for "Fabrikam" displays fields like name, address, balance, and contact details. Users can edit these fields directly, and changes are saved instantly. You can switch between edit and read-only mode to prevent accidental changes.

Transaction records such as sales orders, quotes, invoices, and payments are referred to as documents. These also have structured layouts and can be created from the "New Document" option. Like cards, documents include fields and a fact box for quick reference.

Business Central allows fast, real-time editing of both cards and documents, making it more efficient than many other ERP systems.
