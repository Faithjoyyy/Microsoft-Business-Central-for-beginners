# Role Center in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

The Role Center is the first page you see when logging into Business Central. It acts as the home page or dashboard, and is often referred to as the "home base."

## Understanding Roles

Accessing Business Central is done through a specific role. A role determines:
- What you see on the Role Center.
- What actions and data you have access to.
- Your permissions within the system.

A role is similar to a job title. For example, if you're a controller in your company, your role in Business Central might also be "Controller." Roles tailor the interface and control access to records, reports, and features.

In this demo, the user is in the Business Manager role. This affects the layout, tabs, and statistics shown on the Role Center.

## Role Center Layout

The Role Center is divided into three main sections:

### 1. Navigation Section (Top Header)

- The top bar includes the company name (e.g., `CronusUSA`), which is clickable.
- Clicking the company name returns you to the Role Center or refreshes the page.
- Tabs across the top allow deeper navigation into areas like:
  - Finance
  - Sales
  - Inventory
  - Purchasing
  - Manufacturing
- Clicking "All Reports" opens a full list of categories and tools.

### 2. Bookmarks Section

- Below the tabs are bookmarks for quick access to frequently used pages.
- Examples include:
  - Customers
  - Vendors
  - Items
- You can add or remove bookmarks to personalize your workspace.

### 3. Action & Reporting Section

- This area includes quick action buttons for tasks like creating new vendors or invoices.
- These shortcuts help users perform tasks without navigating through menus.
- The bottom part of the Role Center displays reporting tiles showing real-time data such as:
  - Ongoing purchase orders
  - Sales statistics
  - Other record summaries

These tiles provide current system information and can be used to access related records directly.

## Role Center and Job Responsibilities

In Business Central, the Role Center is designed to show information that is critical to your specific role and responsibilities. For example, if you're a manager responsible for approving purchase orders, you can have a tile that displays the number of purchase orders awaiting your approval. Clicking on that tile will take you directly to the list of orders you need to review and approve.

Other tiles may include "My Incoming Documents" which are personalized, or "Tasks Failed" which are important for business managers to monitor system health and debug issues quickly. Sales managers might see tiles for incoming leads. These tiles help users quickly identify and act on tasks relevant to their role.

## Analytical Reporting and Visuals

The lower section of the Role Center includes analytical reporting tools such as graphs, tiles, and other visual elements. These help users understand performance and activity at a glance.

## Top Navigation Bar (Black Bar)

The top black bar in Business Central contains several key features:

- **App Launcher**: Opens a list of Microsoft apps integrated with Business Central. These include Excel, SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, Power BI, and more. Integration is seamless, allowing users to connect tools like Outlook directly to Business Central for automatic email tracking.

- **Company Selector**: Allows users to switch between different entities or subsidiaries. For example, you can switch between headquarters and regional offices in different countries like the USA, Mexico, or Denmark.

- **Copilot**: Opens a pane where users can interact with Microsoft's AI assistant. Copilot can help with reporting, analytics, debugging, and answering questions. Itâ€™s a powerful tool that continues to evolve.

- **Tell Me Bar (Search)**: A smart search feature that lets users type in what they want to do. For example, typing "employees" will show related pages, reports, and help articles. It simplifies navigation and task execution.

- **Notifications and Settings**: Includes alerts and user settings. Under "My Settings", users can customize their experience and preferences.
