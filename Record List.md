## Customer List View and Analysis Tools

Clicking on the "Customers" bookmark opens a standard list view, which looks similar across all record types (e.g., vendors, items). The main section displays customer records with key details such as customer ID, name, phone number, contact person, credit limit, and balance due. This view can be personalized by adding or removing columns.

To the right is the Fact Box, which shows a summary of information related to the selected record. For example, clicking on "Trey Research" updates the Fact Box to show total sales, outstanding shipments, and other useful stats.

Above the list is a toolbar with several functions:
- Filter View: Useful for narrowing down large datasets (e.g., customers with purchases over \$30,000).
- Analysis Mode: Allows creation of custom views to analyze data (e.g., profit margins, overdue invoices). These views can be saved and reused.
- Action Tabs: Provide shortcuts to create new records (e.g., new customer, new sales order) or perform tasks like exporting data to Excel.

Deleting records is possible but not recommended in ERP systems. It's better to deactivate or exclude records instead.

This section of Business Central is designed to give users quick access to data and tools for managing customer relationships and performing analysis.
