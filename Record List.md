## Working with Records in Business Central

When accessing records like customers or vendors, Business Central displays them in a standard list view. This view shows key information such as customer ID, name, contact details, credit limits, and balances. The layout is consistent across different record types and can be personalized by adding or removing columns.

To the right of the list is the Fact Box, which provides a summary of related data for the selected record. For example, clicking on a customer like "Trey Research" shows total sales, outstanding shipments, and other useful stats.

Above the list is a toolbar with options to:
- Filter records (e.g., customers with purchases over \$30,000).
- Enter Analysis Mode to create custom views and insights (e.g., overdue invoices, profit margins).
- Perform actions like creating new records or exporting data to Excel.

Users can switch between list view and tile view depending on the record type. Tile view is useful for visual records like items or employees.

Bookmarks can be added from within list views to make frequently accessed records available from the Role Center.

### Record Terminology

- Cards: Individual master records such as vendors, customers, employees, items, and fixed assets.
- Documents: Transactional records such as sales orders, quotes, invoices, and payments.

Cards have editable fields and a fact box. Changes are saved instantly and visible to other users in real time. Documents follow a similar layout and can be created from the "New Document" option.

Business Central offers fast, flexible, and user-friendly tools for managing both master and transactional data.
